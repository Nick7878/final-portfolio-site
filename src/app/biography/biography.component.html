        My name is Nicholas Martinez, I am 22 years old and a developer who is currently studying Computer Science at Rutgers University and
        set to graduate May 2021. I started to take a great interest in Computer Science around my junior year of high school when I took an AP Computer Science
        course, and my interest has grown ever since. I have made numerous applications in java, and some websites which you
        can check out on the <a routerLink="/projects">Projects</a> page!</p>

      <p>After high school was over, I decided to get my Associate's degree at Mercer County Community College.
        My experience there was a good stepping stone for what Rutgers would be like, and the decreased workload
        allowed me to work on some pet projects and hone my skills as a programmer.</p>

      <p>Throughout my time at Mercer, I found a part time job at a small software development company
        called Visionware Systems. I started out as a tester, and as time went on they allowed me work on their
        projects. This was incredibly helpful as it helped me gain real world experience and get a feel for
        what code bases would potentially be like at other companies. </p>

      <p>As of right now, I am currently attending Rutgers University in New Brunswick and plan to graduate in May 2021 with my
        Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. So far my experience here has taught me to be a great problem solver,
        and has furthered my interest in programming as a whole.</p>
