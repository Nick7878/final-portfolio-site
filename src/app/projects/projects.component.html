          A feature rich flight reservation system that uses a relational database for persistence.
          My group and I used Java Server Pages (JSP) to create the user interface, and JDBC to interact with the
          database. We used MySql extensively to persist relevant data. View the code <a href="https://github.com/Nick7878/Flight-Reservation-System">here!</a>

          As part of a school project, I implemented a version of the malloc and free functions in C primarily using a Linked List to represent the memory available to the user.
          Each node represents the amount of memory that is allocated by the user, and also represents blocks that are free and can be used in future
          allocations.

        <p class="mt-3">
          As part of a school project, I created a sandwich store application using Java and JavaFX. The user is able to create three types of sandwiches
          and add extra ingredients, with the price being calculated as they add the ingredients. The user is able to save their order to a text document,
          and edit the order on a separate order screen. This project gave me a solid understanding on how to create JavaFX applications.
